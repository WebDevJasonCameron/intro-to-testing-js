# My process

## 2022 02 04 | Working in Class
I couldn't wrap my head around the process of setting up tests.  That is why I decided to wait for the class.  Today, we are now working on the subject in our lectures.

## 2022 01 28 | Fork and Test
Following the instructions of the lesson, I forked this repo and cloned it to my laptop.  Looking ahead, I know I need to push this back to my own GH repo when I'm completed.  That is why I am creating this journal doc.  I want o check to see if I can operate Git using the terminal (a new skill since I have previously focused on using the provided GH desktop UI).  

### 2130 | Cont Work
I am making it through the first few test JS Ex.  However, I am not familiar with what is actually being done.  It looks like JS has several functions that help us tell others what was expected as the code is being processed.  It sounds a lot like Exception Handling.  Yet, it looks completely different.  The ex leads you through several activites and expects you to "get it" as you work though them.  It doesn't exactly explain what is going on... That is a little nerve racking.  I'll keep working on it and hope to figure it out as we go on.
