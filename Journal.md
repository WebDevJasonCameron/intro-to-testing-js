Following the instructions of the lesson, I forked this repo and cloned it to my laptop.  Looking ahead, I know I need to push this back to my own GH repo when I'm completed.  That is why I am creating this journal doc.  I want o check to see if I can operate Git using the terminal (a new skill since I have previously focused on using the provided GH desktop UI).
